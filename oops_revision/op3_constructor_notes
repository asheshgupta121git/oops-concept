    ->it have the same name as class or structor
    ->it don't have a return type.(NOT EVEN Void)
    ->they are onlu called once, at object CREATION
    ->memory allocation happens when constructor is called.

        ->Non-parametrized
        ->Parametrized
        ->Copy constructor(it transfer the property of one object into another object.)

CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING => In java if we make many constructor of same name and according to use java call the desired constructor this phenomenen is called CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING.
    -> constructor overloading is an example of PLOYMORPHISM.

In Java, there is a garbage collector. Which automatically work as an destructor We do not have to create an additional destructor in Java.
